# LoginModule
Hello!
In order to get this up and running you have to set it up.
You have to:    1. go to db_conn.php and fill the variables with your db information
                2. go to setup.php and fill it with all the info about the table you are going to use for the login
If you need to have a more advanced login system you will have to modify the strucure
That's it!
